## TODO:
All Devices
* Every mod source (except in Monitor) should have an enable/disable button and pass through the value when disabled. It should not pass through when enabled.
  - When the Controls are enabled, they should immediately send the current value. This can be used as a "reset" control after the note randomizer (e.g. to reset the pitch bend)
* Time synced logic (in seq and randomizer) should handle tempo changes (need to observe the transport)
* Check if any numeric UI inputs need "steps" set
* Use color scheme for BG of ctrl num inputs (use base color w/ darkest variation)

Sequencer
* Make rate UI consistent with note randomizer (reverse the values - maybe add 12 and 16)
