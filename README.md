## TODO:
Note Mod Randomizer
* Rev option glides from new value to previous value (let's try global at first)
* Finish annotations and UI input names
* Reset button (to reset pitch bend, etc)? Could use the MIDI Controls device though...

All Devices
* Every mod source (except in Monitor) should have an enable/disable button and pass through the value when disabled. It should not pass through when enabled.
* Time synced logic (in seq and randomizer) should handle tempo changes (need to observe the transport)
* Check if any numeric UI inputs need "steps" set
* Use color scheme for BG of ctrl num inputs (use base color w/ darkest variation)
