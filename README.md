## TODO:
All Devices

* Time synced logic (in seq and randomizer) should handle tempo changes (need to observe the transport)
* Check if any numeric UI inputs need "steps" set

Sequencer
* Make rate UI consistent with note randomizer (reverse the values - maybe add 12 and 16)
* Add enable switch for every mod source and let it pass through when disabled (like in the controls and randomizer devices)
