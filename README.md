# Ableton MIDI Modulation Tools

A collection of Ableton Live MIDI Effect devices for working with MIDI modulation.


## Installation

* [Download version 1.0](https://github.com/adamjmurray/ableton-midi-modulation-tools/archive/1.0.zip)
* Unzip and put the folder wherever you want. Keep the files together because some devices will not work without other files in the folder.


## Features

* 6 color-coded modulation sources: mod wheel, aftertouch, pitch bend, and 3 freely assignable "CC" controls.
* Independently enable each modulation source.
* Automate nearly everything (except the sequencer).
* Hover over any control for help in Live's Info View.


### MIDI Controls

* Control the 6 modulation sources with virtual knobs.
* Pass through the modulation source when disabled.
* Automate MIDI modulation in the Arrangement.

### MIDI Mod Monitor

* Monitor incoming MIDI modulations visually.
* Pass through all MIDI.

### MIDI Mod Sequencer

* Independent step sequencers at a variety of clock-syned speeds for each modulation source.
* Up to 64 steps per sequencer.
* Up to 3 step patterns per sequencer with independent loop points for polyrhythms and pseudo-random patterns.
* Multiple output modes combine the 3 step patterns in various ways: average, min, max, or random.
* 3 playback modes: sync to the transport, re-trigger on each note, or one shot playback.
* Slew control to smooth the output and glide between step values.
* Randomization and auto-randomization

### Note Mod Randomizer

* Randomized modulation for every note.
* Control the minimum and maximum value of each modulation source.
* Set the chance to randomize the value of each note.
* Glide to the new value at a variety of speeds.
* Reverse glide from the new value back to the current value to create more contrast between notes.
* Optional legato randomizes values only on the first note of overlapping notes (useful for chords).
