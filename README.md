## TODO:
All Devices

* Time synced logic (in seq and randomizer) should handle tempo changes (need to observe the transport)
  - See the arp, if you use a [translate] to translate to ms, it will run even with the Live transport stopped, and if the translate will output changes when the tempo changes
* Check if any numeric UI inputs need "steps" set

Sequencer
* Make rate UI consistent with note randomizer (reverse the values - maybe add 12 and 16)
* Add enable switch for every mod source and let it pass through when disabled (like in the controls and randomizer devices)
