## TODO:
All Devices
* Every mod source (except in Monitor) should have an enable/disable button and pass through the value when disabled. It should not pass through when enabled.
** Bug in Controls. Assignable CCs not working correctly
* Time synced logic (in seq and randomizer) should handle tempo changes (need to observe the transport)
* Check if any numeric UI inputs need "steps" set

Sequencer
* Make rate UI consistent with note randomizer (reverse the values - maybe add 12 and 16)
